# Stack Explorer

This Android app uses the public Stack Exchange API to explore the content of sites like Stack Overflow, SuperUser and dozens more and find interesting questions and answers.  

Select a site that interest you, choose between the most common tags or add new ones and tap the search button to find new interesting questions randomly selected.  

The app is still in development, and it is not available in the Playstore at the moment.
